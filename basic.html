							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The seC’s office of Investor education and Advocacy
								is issuing this Investor Bulletin to help educate investors
								about the different types of orders they can use to buy
								and sell stocks through a brokerage firm. The following
								are general descriptions of some of the common order
								types and trading instructions that investors may use to
								buy and sell stocks. Please note that some of the order
								types and trading instructions described below may not
								be available through all brokerage firms. Furthermore,
								some brokerage firms may offer additional order types
								and trading instructions not described below. Investors
								should contact their brokerage firms to determine which
								types of orders and trading instructions are available
								for buying and selling as well the firms’ specific policies
								regarding such available orders and trading instructions. </p></td>

			<tr>
						<h2 align="left">: Market Order :</h2>
						<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the
							best available price. Generally, this type of order will
							be executed immediately. However, the price at which
							a market order will be executed is not guaranteed. It is
							important for investors to remember that the last-traded
							price is not necessarily the price at which a market order
							will be executed. In fast-moving markets, the price at which a market order will execute often deviates from
							the last-traded price or “real time” quote . </p>		
						<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Example: An investor places a market order to buy
							1000 shares of XYZ stock when the best offer price
							is $3.00 per share. If other orders are executed first,
							the investor’s market order may be executed at a
							higher price.  </p>
						<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In addition, a fast-moving market may cause parts of
							a large market order to execute at different prices. 
							</p>
						<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Example: An investor places a market order to buy
							1000 shares of XYZ stock at $3.00 per share. In a
							fast-moving market, 500 shares of the order could
							execute at $3.00 per share and the other 500 shares
							execute at a higher price.</p>

				<tr>
							<h2 align="left">: Limit Order :</h2>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific
								price or better. A buy limit order can only be executed
								at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order can only
								be executed at the limit price or higher. A limit order
								is not guaranteed to execute. A limit order can only be
								filled if the stock’s market price reaches the limit price.
								While limit orders do not guarantee execution, they help
								ensure that an investor does not pay more than a predetermined price for a stock. </p>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Example: An investor wants to purchase shares of
								ABC stock for no more than $10. The investor could
								place a limit order for this amount that will only
								execute if the price of ABC stock is $10 or lower. </p>

						<td valign="top" align="right"><h2 align="left">: technical analysis :</h2>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Technical analysis is the study of financial market action. The technician looks at price changes that
								occur on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis or over any other constant time period displayed in
								graphic form, called charts. Hence the name chart analysis. </p>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">A chartist analyzes price charts only, while the technical analyst studies technical indicators derived
								from price changes in addition to the price charts. </p>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Technical analysts examine the price action of the financial markets instead of the fundamental factors that (seem to) effect market prices. Technicians believe that even if all relevant information of a
								particular market or stock was available, you still could not predict a precise market "response" to that
								information. There are so many factors interacting at any one time that it is easy for important ones
								to be ignored in favor of those that are considered as the "flavor of the day."
								 </p>
							<p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The technical analyst believes that all the relevant market information is reflected (or discounted) in
								the price with the exception of shocking news such as natural distasters or acts of God. These factors, however, are discounted very quickly.
								 </p>
								 <p align="left" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Watching financial markets, it becomes obvious that there are trends, momentum and patterns that
									repeat over time, not exactly the same way but similar. Charts are self-similar as they show the same
									fractal structure (a fractal is a tiny pattern; self-similar means the overall pattern is made up of smaller
									versions of the same pattern) whether in stocks, commodities, currencies, bonds. A chart is a mirror
									of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors. Thus, technical analysis is the
									analysis of human mass psychology. Therefore, it is also called behavioral finance. </p></td>
