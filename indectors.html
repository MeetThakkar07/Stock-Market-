	  <td valign="top"><h1 align="">Aroon Indicator :</h1>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The Aroon oscillator is a technical indicator used to measure whether a security is in a trend, and more specifically if the price is hitting new highs or lows over the calculation period (typically 25).</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The indicator can also be used to identify when a new trend is set to begin. The Aroon indicator comprises two lines: an Aroon Up line and an Aroon Down line.</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• When the Aroon Up crosses above the Aroon Down, that is the first sign of a possible trend change. If the Aroon Up hits 100 and stays relatively close to that level while the Aroon Down stays near zero, that is positive confirmation of an uptrend.
		</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The reverse is also true. If Aroon Down crosses above Aroon Up and stays near 100, this indicates that the downtrend is in force.</p>

	  <td valign="top"><h1 align="">MACD :</h1>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator helps traders see the trend direction, as well as the momentum of that trend. It also provides a number of trade signals.</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• When the MACD is above zero, the price is in an upward phase. If the MACD is below zero, it has entered a bearish period.</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The indicator is composed of two lines: the MACD line and a signal line, which moves slower. When MACD crosses below the signal line, it indicates that the price is falling. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, the price is rising. 
		</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• Looking at which side of zero the indicator is on aids in determining which signals to follow. For example, if the indicator is above zero, watch for the MACD to cross above the signal line to buy. If the MACD is below zero, the MACD crossing below the signal line may provide the signal for a possible short trade.

	  <td valign="top"><h1 align="">RSI :</h1>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The relative strength index (RSI) has at least three major uses. The indicator moves between zero and 100, plotting recent price gains versus recent price losses. The RSI levels therefore help in gauging momentum and trend strength. </p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• The most basic use of an RSI is as an overbought and oversold indicator. When RSI moves above 70, the asset is considered overbought and could decline. When the RSI is below 30, the asset is oversold and could rally. However, making this assumption is dangerous; therefore, some traders wait for the indicator to rise above 70 and then drop below before selling, or drop below 30 and then rise back above before buying. </p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• Divergence is another use of the RSI. When the indicator is moving in a different direction than the price, it shows that the current price trend is weakening and could soon reverse.</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• A third use for the RSI is support and resistance levels. During uptrends, a stock will often hold above the 30 level and frequently reach 70 or above. When a stock is in a downtrend, the RSI will typically hold below 70 and frequently reach 30 or below.</p>

	  <td valign="top"><h1 align="">Accumulation/Distribution Line :</h1>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• One of the most commonly used indicators to determine the money flow in and out of a security is the accumulation/distribution line (A/D line).</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• It is similar to the on-balance volume indicator (OBV), but instead of considering only the closing price of the security for the period, it also takes into account the trading range for the period and where the close is in relation to that range. If a stock finishes near its high, the indicator gives volume more weight than if it closes near the midpoint of its range. The different calculations mean that OBV will work better in some cases and A/D will work better in others.</p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• If the indicator line is trending up, it shows buying interest, since the stock is closing above the halfway point of the range. This helps confirm an uptrend. On the other hand, if A/D is falling, that means the price is finishing in the lower portion of its daily range, and thus volume is considered negative. This helps confirm a downtrend. </p>
		<p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">• Traders using the A/D line also watch for divergence. If the A/D starts falling while the price is rising, this signals that the trend is in trouble and could reverse. Similarly, if the price is trending lower and A/D starts rising, that could signal higher prices to come.</p>
